Luggage_ISU
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isubit/luggage_isu.svg?branch=master "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/isubit/luggage_isu)

Luggage_ISU is a fork of Luggage with additions specifically designed for use at Iowa State University.
Luggage is a Drupal 7.x platform for building/maintaining academic websites.

  - Build Luggage from script or Add/Merge Luggage to your current Drupal 7.x project.
  - Enable the features you would like to use.
  - Magic.

Luggage is a managed stable release of Drupal 7.x coupled with several features that together make a platform. The platform can be applied at any time:

> The overriding design goal for the Luggage Platform are discrete fully functional features that are independent of the platform and any Drupal theme.
> When the individual features are combined together a full-featured academic platform emerges.
> Luggage is not an install profile nor a distribution. It can be applied to any Drupal 7 project at any time.
> It can also be removed as simply.

Technology
-----------

Luggage uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Drupal][] - Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications.
* [Drush][] - a command-line shell and scripting interface for Drupal
* [Ckeditor][] - HTML text editor designed to simplify web content creation
* [Flexslider2][] - The best responsive slider. Period.
* [Apache Solr][] - search platform.
* [Shibboleth][] - authentication

Installation
--------------

Below is the brief run-down on how to install Luggage_isu. The full installation documentation can be found [here](http://www.biology-it.iastate.edu/luggage_doc/installing-luggage-scratch#).

#####Assumptions:
* Drush is installed
* Git is installed

Clone this repo into the root directory that your web server points to.

Run the build script found within the *scripts* directory:
```
source ./scripts/build_luggage_isu.sh
```

The last line of output from the script, if successful, will be a root user one-time login link. Copy and append everything from "/user" and on, to the end of the luggage installation url in a web browser of your choice. Typically, the final link will look something like this:
``` 
http://localhost/luggage/user/reset/1/1409061179/KjbHsr6O7FRaz-__WShbgWuPwKHKrXHy6QGV_AQu02E/login
```

You are now logged in as the root user, allowing you to develop using the power of Luggage! Enjoy!
